# NFL API Client

Welcome to the documentation for the `nfl_api_client`.

## About

`nfl_api_client` is a Python package that provides a simple and flexible interface for accessing ESPN's NFL data. It wraps ESPN's hidden API endpoints and returns clean, structured data. 

This package is currently in active development. While many endpoints are implemented (such as rosters, depth charts, standings, and stats), others are still being added and refined. You can track the CHANGELOG for more updates. 


## Installation

This package requires Python 3.9+ and uses `httpx` and `pandas` as dependencies for fetching and processing the data.
